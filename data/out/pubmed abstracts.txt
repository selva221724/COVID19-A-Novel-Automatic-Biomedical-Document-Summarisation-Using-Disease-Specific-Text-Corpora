Of considerable interest is the adoption of Ayurveda by the mainstream medical system in some European countries (e.g., Hungary), emphasizing this modality is increasing worldwide recognition. So, the need of the hour is to explore the claims of Indian medicinal flora and open up the facets of many Indian plants which are being examined for their beneficial role in diabetes. Except 2 species, all are Angiospermic plants found mostly in wild condition. Such remedies however, were not only combined with allopathic ones but also eventually replaced without the doctor\'s consultation.Many plants have been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in Indian system of medicine and in other ancient systems of the world. Unfortunately, because of its low solubility and oral bioavailability, the biomedical potential of curcumin is not easy to exploit; for this reason more attention has been given to nanoparticles and liposomes, which are able to improve curcumin\'s bioavailability. There are about 800 plants which have been reported to show antidiabetic potential. .It discusses nuances of types of carbohydrates and fats and explains associations of increased dietary fiber intake, balanced intake of low and high glycemic index foods and substitution of saturated fats with plant-based polyunsaturated fats in improving outcomes of T2DM and attenuating risk factors.It revisits historical Indian studies and provides information on appropriate dietary intake of carbohydrates (60-70%), proteins (~ 20%) and fats (10%) that will be acceptable and beneficial in an Indian T2DM population.AIM OF THE STUDY: To document and compare the traditional uses of medicinal herbs and spices brought by Indian indentured labourers with their current uses in Mauritius and India, and to review pharmacological studies of such plants.It is anticipated that this study will revive the interest in safeguarding and promoting the ancestral knowledge on the uses of such plants.According to the World Health Organization, up to 90% of population in developing countries use plants and its products as traditional medicine for primary health care.The review provides a starting point for future studies aimed at isolation, purification, and characterization of bioactive antidiabetic compounds present in these plants.In view of these pharmacologic properties, W. somnifera is a potential drug candidate to treat various clinical conditions, particularly related to the nervous system.Additionally, it has demonstrated the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species, modulate mitochondrial function, regulate apoptosis, and reduce inflammation and enhance endothelial function.Three compounds, gymnemosides ND7-9, exerted significant stimulatory effects on the uptake of 2-NBDG in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells and thus have potential as lead molecules for anti-diabetes agents.Morphological and anatomical descriptions, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 DNA sequencing, and acid hydrolysis analyses showed that G. sylvestre samples from Vietnam are distinguishable from those of Indian origin and thus suggest a dissimilarity among G. sylvestre samples with different geographic distributions.It has been demonstrated that curcumin has beneficial effects on several ocular diseases, such as chronic anterior uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and dry eye syndrome.Unfortunately, because of its low solubility and oral bioavailability, the biomedical potential of curcumin is not easy to exploit; for this reason more attention has been given to nanoparticles and liposomes, which are able to improve curcumin's bioavailability.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants belong to the oldest known health care products that have been used by human beings all over the world and are major components of the formulations used in indigenous system of medicine practiced in many countries.AIM OF THE STUDY: The article is aimed to provide the effort and initiatives of ICMR towards research on medicinal plants and its contributions on consolidation of Indian research on medicinal plants that are very relevant and important in the national context.The various products of coconut include tender coconut water, copra, coconut oil, raw kernel, coconut cake, coconut toddy, coconut shell and wood based products, coconut leaves, coir pith etc.The parts of its fruit like coconut kernel and tender coconut water have numerous medicinal properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, antidermatophytic, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, immunostimulant.The current review focuses on Indian medicinal plant drugs and plants used in the treatment of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.Though there are various approaches to reduce the ill-effects of diabetes and hyperlipidemia and its secondary complications, plant-based drugs are preferred due to lesser side effects and low cost.So, the need of the hour is to explore the claims of Indian medicinal flora and open up the facets of many Indian plants which are being examined for their beneficial role in diabetes.So, we created a database (InDiaMed) of Indian medicinal plants that captures their role in anti-diabetic activity.Besides the established medicinal plants in the Indian System of medicine like Acorus calamus, Centella asiatica, Oroxylum indicum and Phyllanthus emblica, a number of other species like Ageratum conizoides, Blumeopsis flava, Clerodendrum glandulosum, Gynura cusimbua, Hedyotis scandens and Paederia foetida also has maximum use reports.AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aimed to identify the medicinally and pharmacologically important species with understanding the traditional healing practices and to compare medicinal plant knowledge among the informants of the three tribes under Zeliangrong group.Of considerable interest is the adoption of Ayurveda by the mainstream medical system in some European countries (e.g., Hungary), emphasizing this modality is increasing worldwide recognition.Modern medicines, despite offering a variety of effective treatment options, can have several adverse effects.In the present article, we hypothesize recent discoveries with respect to active ingredients from Indian medicinal plants i.e., polypeptide-p (protein analogue act as artificial insulin), charantin (a steroidal saponin), momordicin (an alkaloid) and osmotin (ubiquitous plant protein and animal analogue of human adeponectin) possessing anti-hyperglycemic potential for diabetes type II.It has various complications as hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease as well as peripheral neuropathy.In order to avoid such side effects, respondents decreased medication dosage and turned to non-allopathic remedies that usually consisted of herbal medications that, according to Indians and Pakistanis, did not cause side effects as medications did and tackled the cause of the disease rather than its symptoms.Drawing on data collected during a 16-month ethnographic investigation, this paper explores practices around Indians' and Pakistanis' use of herbal medications for diabetes control.Many plants have been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in Indian system of medicine and in other ancient systems of the world.Since the plant products have less side effects, they have the potential as good hypoglycemic drugs.Mangrove ecosystem has many potential species that are traditionally used by the coastal communities for their traditional cure for health ailments as evidenced by their extensive uses to treat hepatic disorders, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, anti-inflammation, anticancer, and skin diseases, etc.In this context, we aimed to compile the works done on the antidiabetic activities of mangrove species from Indian coastal regions especially on Andaman and Nicobar Islands as well as some recent works reported from other countries.METHODS: All relevant RCTs were searched using the keywords: "GQD", "T2DM", "hyperglycemia" and "insulin" from the electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Korean databases, Chinese medical databases, and Indian scientific database.OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gegen Qinlian decoction (GQD) for normalizing hyperglycemia in T2DM patients by pooling all available RCTs.There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil, fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 have a glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study.Despite these limitations, there are sufficient data for several herbs or herbal formulas to warrant further studies.After 3 months of treatment, C. longa produced significant reduction from baseline in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (p = .002), left brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (p = .001), aortic augmentation pressure (p = .007), aortic augmentation index (p = .007), and aortic augmentation index at heart rate 75 (p = .018) as compared with the placebo group.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Curcuma longa on arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.In conclusion, A. alnifolia, P. indica, and O. obtusata could be promising sources for the treatment of AD and DM since these fractions induced significant anticholinesterase, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and neuroprotection effects attributable to phenolic, flavonoid, and terpenoid contents and encourage further studies for development of multifunctional therapeutic agent for AD and DM dual therapy.The methanolic extract and its derived chloroform fractions exhibited remarkable inhibitory capacities with IC50 values being found at the μg/mL level.The present experiment was conceptualised to explore the therapeutic response of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), a major active constituent of Ligusticum chuanxiong, a Chinese traditional medicinal plant, in high-fat diet (HFD)-streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats and to identify the possible mechanism of action.In this study, seventeen Indian medicinal plants with known hypoglycemic properties were subjected to sequential solvent extraction and tested for α-amylase inhibition, in order to assess and evaluate their inhibitory potential on PPA (porcine pancreatic α-amylase). Indian medicinal plants used in the Ayurvedic traditional system to treat diabetes are a valuable source of novel anti-diabetic agents.This article aims to provide a comprehensive review on various plant species from Indian biosphere and their constituents, which have been shown to display potent hypoglycemic activity.The plants provide a potential source of hypoglycemic drugs because many plants and plant derived compounds have been used in the treatment of diabetes.It is concluded that cereal grains are not only the potential sources of energy but also possess the therapeutic role in preventing metabolic disorders and decreasing the risk factors for cardiovascular and renal diseases.Cereal grains which form the staple diet for humans in most of the countries are increasingly being used to treat diabetes and other associated disorders in view of their anti-diabetic and anti-lipidemic potential.
