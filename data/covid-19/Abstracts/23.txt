In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of 
pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood 
Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as 
the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case 
numbers have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including 
the wholesale isolation of Wuhan. Alongside this has been a robust scientific 
response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid 
development of highly specific diagnostics. This article will review the new 
knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its 
clinical features.
