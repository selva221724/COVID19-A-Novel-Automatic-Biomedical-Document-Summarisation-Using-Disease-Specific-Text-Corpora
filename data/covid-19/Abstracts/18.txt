The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originating in Wuhan, 
China, has become a major public health challenge for not only China but also 
countries around the world. The World Health Organization announced that the 
outbreaks of the novel coronavirus have constituted a public health emergency of 
international concern. As of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 has been recognized in 
34 countries, with a total of 80,239 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,700 
deaths. Infection control measures are necessary to prevent the virus from 
further spreading and to help control the epidemic situation. Due to the 
characteristics of dental settings, the risk of cross infection can be high 
between patients and dental practitioners. For dental practices and hospitals in 
areas that are (potentially) affected with COVID-19, strict and effective 
infection control protocols are urgently needed. This article, based on our 
experience and relevant guidelines and research, introduces essential knowledge 
about COVID-19 and nosocomial infection in dental settings and provides 
recommended management protocols for dental practitioners and students in 
(potentially) affected areas.
