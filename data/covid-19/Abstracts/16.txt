The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory 
syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This syndrome has been named 
COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization. The 
starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is 
said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human 
transmission. This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory 
syndrome (MERS) started in 2012. COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is 
currently spreading all over the world. The infection mainly affects patients 
over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of 
comorbidities. Children are pauci- or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is most often 
based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular 
biology methods. In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is 
currently mainly symptomatic. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more 
difficult to control than what the first data suggested. The key strategy to 
SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission. Preventive measures are mainly based on 
the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the 
environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts 
in the population and protecting populations at risk.
