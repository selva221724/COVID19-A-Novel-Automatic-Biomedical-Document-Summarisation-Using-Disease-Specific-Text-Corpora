
The emergence of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, which causes severe 
respiratory tract infections in humans (COVID-19), has become a global health 
concern. Most coronaviruses infect animals but can evolve into strains that 
cross the species barrier and infect humans. At the present, there is no single 
specific vaccine or efficient antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Recently, we 
showed that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment reduces inflammation of 
intestinal epithelial cells and eliminates overgrowth of the opportunistic human 
fungal pathogen Candida albicans in the murine gut. Immunotherapy with IVIg 
could be employed to neutralize COVID-19. However, the efficacy of IVIg would be 
better if the immune IgG antibodies were collected from patients who have 
recovered from COVID-19 in the same city, or the surrounding area, in order to 
increase the chance of neutralizing the virus. These immune IgG antibodies will 
be specific against COVID-19 by boosting the immune response in newly infected 
patients. Different procedures may be used to remove or inactivate any possible 
pathogens from the plasma of recovered coronavirus patient derived immune IgG, 
including solvent/detergent, 60 °C heat-treatment, and nanofiltration. Overall, 
immunotherapy with immune IgG antibodies combined with antiviral drugs may be an 
alternative treatment against COVID-19 until stronger options such as vaccines 
are available.
