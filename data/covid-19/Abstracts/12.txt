Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness 
such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of 
Hubei, China. The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel 
coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like 
SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, 
SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As 
COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss 
posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the 
development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. 
Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and 
several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically 
effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop 
vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Here, we review the current status of 
epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.
