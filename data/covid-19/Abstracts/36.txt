
In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 
China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. 
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission via 
droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation 
times of 2-14 days. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are 
essential to cure patients. This paper reviews the literature on all available 
information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of 
COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion 
and vaccines, are discussed in this article. In addition, registered trials 
investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.
