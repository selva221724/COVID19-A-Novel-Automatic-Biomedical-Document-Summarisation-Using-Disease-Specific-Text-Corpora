Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases 
(COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of 
COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients 
has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer 
patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer 
patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. 
Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung 
cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The 
protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer 
patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 
outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory 
symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to 
evaluate the risk of COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous 
and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively 
protect the patients from COVID-19.
