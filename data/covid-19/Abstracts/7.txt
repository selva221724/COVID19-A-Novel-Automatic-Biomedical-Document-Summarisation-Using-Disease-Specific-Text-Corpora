Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the 
causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public 
health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed 
to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is 
likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of 
COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently 
administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce 
person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the 
current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce 
transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, 
health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the 
symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and 
future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.
