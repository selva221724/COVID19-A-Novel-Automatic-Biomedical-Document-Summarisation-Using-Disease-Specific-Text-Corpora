Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain 
that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans. On 
December 31st 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of 
cases with pneumonia of unknown origin from Wuhan City, Hubei province of China. 
The WHO announced in February 2020 that COVID-19 is the official name of the 
coronavirus diseases. A total of 519,899 confirmed cases with 23,592 deaths 
linked to this pathogen as on March 27, 2020 have been reported. Due to 
increasing number of infected people across the continents and huge loss to 
human life, the WHO has declared the novel COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. A 
pandemic is defined as the "worldwide spread" of a new disease. Currently, no 
COVID-19 specific treatments have been approved by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (US-FDA). However, the current treatment options include 
hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra®), and 
nitazoxanide. In recent past, some natural herbal compounds have demonstrated 
encouraging anti-viral properties. This article attempted to summarize available 
information on the reported anti-viral activity of some natural products.
