Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were 
the only coronaviruses known to infect humans. Following the SARS outbreak, 5 
additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel 
coronavirus COVID-19, believed to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, 
China. SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are 
associated with high mortality. In this review, the epidemiology, 
pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered COVID-19 are 
reviewed, with a focus on best practices and the public health implications.
