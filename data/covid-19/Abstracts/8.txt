
At the end of 2019 a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome expanded globally from 
Wuhan, China. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the 
SARS-Cov-2 virus a global pandemic. We performed a narrative review to describe 
existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective. 
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. 
Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full 
health, social and economic impact of this global disaster, this review 
represents a picture of the current state of the art. In particular, we focus on 
public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, 
case management, emergency response and preparedness.
