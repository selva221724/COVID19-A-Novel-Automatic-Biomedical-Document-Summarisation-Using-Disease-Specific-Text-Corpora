The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) outbreak in 
Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries across the world including the UK 
with an increasing death toll. This will inevitably lead to an increase in the 
number of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths at 
autopsy. The Royal College of Pathologists has responded to this concern with 
the release of a briefing on autopsy practice relating to COVID-19. The 
following article is a summary and interpretation of these guidelines. It 
includes a description of hazard group 3 organisms, the category to which 
SARS-CoV-2 has been assigned, a brief description of what is currently known 
about the pathological and autopsy findings in COVID-19, a summary of the 
recommendations for conducting autopsies in suspected COVID-19 cases and the 
techniques for making the diagnosis at autopsy. It concludes by considering the 
clinicopathological correlation and notification of such cases.
