Recently, an outbreak of viral pneumonitis in Wuhan, Hubei, China successively 
spread as a global pandemia, led to the identification of a novel 
betacoronavirus species, the 2019 novel coronavirus, successively designated 
2019-nCoV then SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging 
from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Few cases have been observed in 
children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than 
other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies. This review provides an 
overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the 
associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 
6?months of life.
