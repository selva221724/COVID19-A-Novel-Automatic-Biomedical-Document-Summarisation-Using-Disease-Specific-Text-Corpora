
This article aims at collecting all information needed for dentists regarding 
the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world by reviewing articles published by 
now. In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, 
China. There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, 
supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly 
evolving into transmission from human to human. The pathogen was classified as 
2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in 
infected patients' saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and 
other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious 
disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva 
diagnostic for COVID-19. There has so far been no evidence from randomized 
controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, 
and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive. Since the ACE-2 was 
expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 
infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the 
future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life. As a result, the 
whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe 
environment by following the guideline in this study.
