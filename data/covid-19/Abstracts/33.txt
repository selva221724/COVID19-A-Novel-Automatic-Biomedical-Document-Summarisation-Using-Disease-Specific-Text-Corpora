The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency 
of international concern. With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence 
of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention 
measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological 
and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 
2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely 
experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans 
at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence 
binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier 
for transmission of the virus to farm animals. We propose, based on the One 
Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a 
cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.
