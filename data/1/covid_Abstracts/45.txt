(COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, 
China, which has subsequently affected more than 200 countries worldwide 
including Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and other places. The number of 
infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 
is only by nucleic acid testing.
OBJECTIVE: To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, 
imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing 
the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a 
non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical
