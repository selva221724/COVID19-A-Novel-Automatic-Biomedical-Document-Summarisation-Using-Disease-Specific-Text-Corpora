China in December 2019, was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This 
disease was named as "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first 
identified as an etiological pathogen of COVID-19, belonging to the species of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). The speed 
of both the geographical transmission and the sudden increase in numbers of 
cases is much faster than SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 
COVID-19 is the first global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, which outbreaks 
in 211 countries/territories/areas. The vaccine against COVID-19, regarded as an 
effective prophylactic strategy for control and prevention, is being developed 
in about 90 institutions worldwide. The experiences and lessons encountered in 
the previous SARS and MERS vaccine research can be used for reference in the 
development of COVID-19 vaccine. The present paper hopes to provide some 
insights for COVID-19 vaccines researchers.
