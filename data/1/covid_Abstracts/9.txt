Before the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, coronaviruses 
(CoVs) were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans.  In addition, in 2012, another new CoV responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome was identified. 
Both infections were considered a threat to global health security. At present, 
the third epidemic caused by a CoV is being faced. This new CoV, called 
2019-nCoV, was originated in the city of Wuhan, China, and has been linked to 
severe respiratory infections in humans
