The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, emerged in Wuhan, 
China in the end of 2019, has claimed more than 2600 lives as of 24 February 
2020 and posed a huge threat to global public health. The Chinese government has 
implemented control measures including setting up special hospitals and travel 
restriction to mitigate the spread. We propose conceptual models for the 
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural 
reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, 
hospitalisation and quarantine. We employe the estimates of these two key 
components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, 
incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, and then compute future 
trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it 
successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light 
on understanding the trends of the outbreak.
