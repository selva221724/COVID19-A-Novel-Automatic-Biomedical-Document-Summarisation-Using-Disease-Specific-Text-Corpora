The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global 
public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report 
our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
(ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host 
cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of 
spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding 
and camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our 
study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike 
glycoprotein potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory 
factor for hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique 
features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.
