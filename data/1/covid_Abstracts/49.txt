
Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite 
drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is 
the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by 
pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities 
have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the 
search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In 
the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a 
public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of 
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was 
previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including 
SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of 
COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we 
discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 
replication cycle.
