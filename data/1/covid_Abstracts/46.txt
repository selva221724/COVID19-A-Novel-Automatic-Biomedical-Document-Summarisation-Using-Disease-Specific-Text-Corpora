We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in travellers from 
Wuhan, China to Thailand. Both were independent introductions on separate 
flights, discovered with thermoscanners and confirmed with RT-PCR and genome 
sequencing. Both cases do not seem directly linked to the Huanan Seafood Market 
in Hubei but the viral genomes are identical to four other sequences from Wuhan, 
suggesting early spread within the city already in the first week of January.
