ngiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major enzyme responsible for 
conversion of Ang II into Ang-(1-7). It also acts as the receptor for severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, which causes Coronavirus 
Disease (COVID)-19. In recognition of the importance of ACE2 and to celebrate 20 
years since its discovery, the journal will publish a focused issue on the basic 
science and (patho)physiological role of this multifunctional protein.
