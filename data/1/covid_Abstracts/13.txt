An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei 
province in China emerged in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was identified 
as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is caused by a 
betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that affects the lower respiratory tract and 
manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and 
quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 90,870 
laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide. In response to this 
global outbreak, we summarise the current state of knowledge surrounding 
COVID-19.
