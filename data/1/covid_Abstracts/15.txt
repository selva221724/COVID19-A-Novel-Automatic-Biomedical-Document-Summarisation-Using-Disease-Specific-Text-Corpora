Through literature review and group discussion, Special Expert Group for Control 
of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive 
Medicine Association formulated an update on the epidemiological characteristics 
of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The initial source of the 2019 novel 
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, 
China, with pangolins as a potential animal host. Currently the main source of 
infection is NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious. The 
virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact. People are all 
generally susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, 
and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. 
Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, 
and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. 
Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic 
surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of 
suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening 
prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing 
possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese 
Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.
