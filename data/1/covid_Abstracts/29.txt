Since December 2019, 62 medical staff of Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China have 
been hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019. During the post-discharge 
surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic 
cases (3.23%). Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological 
manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild. In 
conclusion, a small proportion of recovered patients may test positive after 
discharge, and post-discharge surveillance and isolation need to be 
strengthened.
