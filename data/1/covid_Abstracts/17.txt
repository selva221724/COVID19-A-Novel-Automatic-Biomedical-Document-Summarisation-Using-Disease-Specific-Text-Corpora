A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is 
limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the 
incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), 
which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and 
describe its public health implications.
DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 
2020 and 24 February 2020.
SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and 
countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei 
province, China
