Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their 
bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng 
Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical 
course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant 
abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous 
immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very 
important.  Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor 
Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of the 
COVID-19 cases. He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 patients. For 
severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive 
treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial. The 
medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique 
characteristics of each patient.
