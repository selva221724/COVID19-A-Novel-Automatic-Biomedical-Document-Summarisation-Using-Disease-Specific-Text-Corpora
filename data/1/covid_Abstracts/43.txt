With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had 
showed re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital. 
This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also 
be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample 
sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the 
re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that 
in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from 
hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for 
patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. 
For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after 
hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge 
evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients 
and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.
