The Asian food pattern primarily embraces rice and rice-based products, which 
mainly comprise 90% starch. Among these various food products, Idli is mostly 
prepared through fermentation. It has high palatability, and the rapid and 
highly digestible nature of the food product results in a higher post-glucose 
level in diabetic patients. A heat-treated Idli rice sample was prepared by 
roasting parboiled rice at the temperature range of 155 to 165 Â°C for 65 to 75 
s. Idli/rice-based Dokala made from heat-treated rice is better when compared to 
untreated rice in terms of its microbiological profile and physiochemical 
properties. The proximate composition of heat-treated parboiled rice Idli/Rice 
Dokala showed slightly higher values than the untreated parboiled rice Idli/Rice 
Dokala, which reveals that it has marginally higher nutritive value. 
Determination of the Rapidly Available Glucose (RAG) and Slowly Available 
Glucose (SAG) values, SEM analysis, resistant starch analysis, microbial assay, 
and in vivo studies were performed to determine the glycemic index (GI) and 
glycemic load in normal and diabetic persons. Sensory analysis also proved that 
heat-treated Idli/Rice Dokala is superior to untreated based on the color, 
flavor, appearance, taste, and texture.
