According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), India has 62.4 million 
people with diabetes and by 2030 it is predicted that the number will rise to 
100 million. Studies claim that there are around 410 experimentally proven 
Indian medicinal plants which have anti-diabetic activity, of which the 
mechanism of action of 109 plants has been elucidated or reported. So, the need 
of the hour is to explore the claims of Indian medicinal flora and open up the 
facets of many Indian plants which are being examined for their beneficial role 
in diabetes. So, we created a database (InDiaMed) of Indian medicinal plants 
that captures their role in anti-diabetic activity. InDiaMed's features include 
chemical, pharmacological, biochemical and geographical information of the 
medicinal plant, scientifically relevant information of the plant, and the 
coherent research done on it in the field of diabetes. The database also 
includes the list of poly-herbal formulations which are used for treatment of 
diabetes in India.
