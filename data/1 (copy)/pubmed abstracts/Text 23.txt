Diabetes mellitus is caused due to deficiency in production of insulin by the 
pancreas, or by the ineffectiveness of the insulin produced. It is a global 
problem and number of those affected is increasing day by day. The plants 
provide a potential source of hypoglycemic drugs because many plants and plant 
derived compounds have been used in the treatment of diabetes. Several medicinal 
plants have found potential use as hypoglycemic in the Indian system of 
medicines, including ayurveda. Many Indian plants have been investigated for 
their beneficial use in different types of diabetes and reports occur in 
numerous scientific journals. This article aims to provide a comprehensive 
review on various plant species from Indian biosphere and their constituents, 
which have been shown to display potent hypoglycemic activity. The use of herbs 
as hypoglycemic is a major avenue in Indian perspectives particularly for 
treating diabetes, which require to be explored more effectively as there are so 
many literatures available on these aspects. This paper describes the chemistry, 
activity and usage of the constituents isolated from these plants from India for 
the treatment of diabetes.
