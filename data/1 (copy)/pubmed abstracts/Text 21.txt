The present experiment was conceptualised to explore the therapeutic 
response of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), a major active constituent of Ligusticum 
chuanxiong, a Chinese traditional medicinal plant, in high-fat diet 
(HFD)-streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats and to identify the possible 
mechanism of action.
