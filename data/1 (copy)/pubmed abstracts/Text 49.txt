Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) describes a diverse group of 
medical and health care systems, practices, and products not currently 
considered to be part of conventional medicine. Inadequacies in current 
treatments for diabetes have led 2 to 3.6 million Americans to use CAM for 
diabetes treatment, despite limited studies of safety and efficacy of CAM 
methods. CAM is used mostly by West Indians, Africans, Indians, Latin Americans, 
or Asians. Prayer, acupuncture, massage, hot tub therapy, biofeedback, and yoga 
have been used as well as various plant remedies for treating diabetes. Several 
CAM practices and herbal remedies are promising for diabetes treatment, but 
further rigorous study is needed in order to establish safety, efficacy, and 
mechanism of action. In the meantime, it is important to be aware that many 
patients with diabetes may be using CAM and to consider potential interactions 
with conventional medicines being used.
