Diabetes is a metabolic hyperglycemic condition that progressively develops, 
effect small and large sensory fibers in the affected population. It has various 
complications as hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, blindness, 
kidney disease as well as peripheral neuropathy. Sulfonylureas, 
thiazolidinediones, metformin, biguanidine, acarbose and insulin are commonly 
used drugs for diabetic patients, but these all have certain side effects. Even 
metformin, that is known as the miracle drug for diabetes has been found to be 
associated with side effects, as during treatment it involves complications with 
eyes, kidneys, peripheral nerves, heart and vasculature. In the present article, 
we hypothesize recent discoveries with respect to active ingredients from Indian 
medicinal plants i.e., polypeptide-p (protein analogue act as artificial 
insulin), charantin (a steroidal saponin), momordicin (an alkaloid) and osmotin 
(ubiquitous plant protein and animal analogue of human adeponectin) possessing 
anti-hyperglycemic potential for diabetes type II. Therefore, plants as herbal 
therapy have preventive care of hyperglycemia accompanied with healthy lifestyle 
which can provide significant decline in the incidences of diabetes in future.
