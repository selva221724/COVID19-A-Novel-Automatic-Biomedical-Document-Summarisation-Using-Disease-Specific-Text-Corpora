Diabetes mellitus is characterized by increased central arterial stiffness and 
endothelial dysfunction leading to increased risk of cardiovascular 
complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Curcuma longa 
on arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 136 
patients of type 2 diabetes. Among them, 114 completed at least one follow-up 
visit and included for data analysis. Arterial stiffness parameters were 
measured at baseline and every month for 3 months and endothelial dysfunction 
markers at baseline and after 3 months of treatment with C. longa or placebo. 
These parameters were compared between the two groups. Both C. longa and placebo 
groups were comparable at baseline. After 3 months of treatment, C. longa 
produced significant reduction from baseline in carotid-femoral pulse wave 
velocity (p = .002), left brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (p = .001), aortic 
augmentation pressure (p = .007), aortic augmentation index (p = .007), and 
aortic augmentation index at heart rate 75 (p = .018) as compared with the 
placebo group. Three months treatment with C. longa significantly decreases 
arterial stiffness as compared with placebo in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients.
