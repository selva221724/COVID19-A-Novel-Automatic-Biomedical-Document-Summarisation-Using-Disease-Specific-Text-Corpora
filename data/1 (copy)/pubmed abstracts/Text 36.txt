Diabetes mellitus (DM) is not one disease but is a heterogonous group of 
syndromes. Contrary to the popular belief DM is a metabolic disorder 
characterized by increased blood glucose level (hyperglycemia) and this is 
because of insufficient or inefficient insulin secretary response. Glucose is 
the main energy source for the body, and in the case of DM, management of 
glucose becomes irregular. There are around 410 experimentally proven medicinal 
plants having antidiabetic properties but the complete mechanism of action is 
available only for about 109. There are several medicinal plants whose extract 
modulate glycolysis, Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, HMP shunt pathway, glycogen 
synthesis and their degradation, cholesterol synthesis, metabolism and 
absorption of carbohydrates, and synthesis and release of insulin. This paper 
provides a comprehensive review of the mode of action of medicinal plants that 
exhibit anti-diabetic properties.
