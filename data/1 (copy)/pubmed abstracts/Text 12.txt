Type 2 diabetes has become a global epidemic. Modern medicines, despite offering 
a variety of effective treatment options, can have several adverse effects. 
Ayurveda, a science that uses herbal medicines extensively, originated in India. 
Of considerable interest is the adoption of Ayurveda by the mainstream medical 
system in some European countries (e.g., Hungary), emphasizing this modality is 
increasing worldwide recognition. From ancient times, some of these herbal 
preparations have been used in the treatment of diabetes. This paper reviews the 
accumulated literature for 10 Indian herbs that have antidiabetic activity and 
that have been scientifically tested. Few of these herbs, such as Momordica 
charantia, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Trigonella foenum greacum, have been 
reported to be beneficial for treating type 2 diabetes. Mechanisms such as the 
stimulating or regenerating effect on beta cells or extrapancreatic effects are 
proposed for the hypoglycemic action of these herbs.
