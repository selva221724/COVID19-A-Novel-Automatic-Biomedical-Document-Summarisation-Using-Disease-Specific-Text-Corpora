Coconut, Cocos nucifera L., is a tree that is cultivated for its multiple 
utilities, mainly for its nutritional and medicinal values. The various products 
of coconut include tender coconut water, copra, coconut oil, raw kernel, coconut 
cake, coconut toddy, coconut shell and wood based products, coconut leaves, coir 
pith etc. Its all parts are used in someway or another in the daily life of the 
people in the traditional coconut growing areas. It is the unique source of 
various natural products for the development of medicines against various 
diseases and also for the development of industrial products. The parts of its 
fruit like coconut kernel and tender coconut water have numerous medicinal 
properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, 
antidermatophytic, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, immunostimulant. 
Coconut water and coconut kernel contain microminerals and nutrients, which are 
essential to human health, and hence coconut is used as food by the peoples in 
the globe, mainly in the tropical countries. The coconut palm is, therefore, 
eulogised as 'Kalpavriksha' (the all giving tree) in Indian classics, and thus 
the current review describes the facts and phenomena related to its use in 
health and disease prevention.
