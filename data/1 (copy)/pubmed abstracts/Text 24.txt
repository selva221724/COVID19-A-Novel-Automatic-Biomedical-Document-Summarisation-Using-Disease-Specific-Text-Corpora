Over the last few decades, life style changes have resulted in drastic increase 
in the incidence of diabetes all over the world, especially in the developing 
countries. Oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin form the main stay in 
controlling diabetes but they have prominent side effects and fail to 
significantly alter the course of diabetic complications. Appropriate diet and 
exercise programs that form a part of lifestyle modifications have proven to be 
greatly effective in the management of this disease. Dietary therapy is showing 
a bright future in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Cereal grains which 
form the staple diet for humans in most of the countries are increasingly being 
used to treat diabetes and other associated disorders in view of their 
anti-diabetic and anti-lipidemic potential. Given this background, this paper 
reviews the possible mechanisms of lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels 
possessed by various commonly consumed cereal grains. It is concluded that 
cereal grains are not only the potential sources of energy but also possess the 
therapeutic role in preventing metabolic disorders and decreasing the risk 
factors for cardiovascular and renal diseases.
