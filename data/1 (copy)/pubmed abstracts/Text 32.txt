Obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing in rural and urban regions of South 
Asia including India. Pattern of fat deposition in abdomen, ectopic fat 
deposition (liver, pancreas) and also low lean mass are contributory to 
early-onset insulin resistance, dysmetabolic state and diabetes in Asian 
Indians. These metabolic perturbations are further exacerbated by changing 
lifestyle, diet urbanization, and mechanization. Important dietary imbalances 
include increasing use of oils containing high amount of trans fatty acids and 
saturated fats (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, palmolein oil) use of deep 
frying method and reheating of oils for cooking, high intake of saturated fats, 
sugar and refined carbohydrates, low intake of protein, fiber and increasing 
intake of processed foods. Although dietary intervention trials are few; the 
data show that improving quality of carbohydrates (more complex carbohydrates), 
improving fat quality (more monounsaturated fatty acids and omega 3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids) and increasing protein intake could improve blood 
glucose, serum insulin, lipids, inflammatory markers and hepatic fat, but more 
studies are needed. Finally, regulatory framework must be tightened to impose 
taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, oils such as palmolein, and dietary fats and 
limit trans fats.
