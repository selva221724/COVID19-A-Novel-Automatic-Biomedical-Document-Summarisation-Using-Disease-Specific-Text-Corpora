Diabetic nephropathy (DN), an end-stage renal disorder, has posed a 
menace to humankind globally, because of its complex nature and poorly 
understandable intricate mechanism. In recent times, functional foods as 
potential health benefits have been gaining attention of consumers and 
researchers alike. Rich in antioxidants, the peel and seed of pomegranate have 
previously demonstrated protection against oxidative-stress-related diseases, 
including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and cancer.
PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the ameliorative role of 
pomegranate peel extract-stabilized gold nanoparticle (PPE-AuNP) on 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN in an experimental murine model.
