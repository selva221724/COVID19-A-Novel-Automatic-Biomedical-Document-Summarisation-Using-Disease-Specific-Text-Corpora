Drawing on data collected during a 16-month ethnographic investigation, this 
paper explores practices around Indians' and Pakistanis' use of herbal 
medications for diabetes control. The ethnographic study was conducted among 
Indian and Pakistani migrants in Edinburgh, Scotland and included extended 
participant observation, six group discussions and 21 semi-structured 
interviews. Respondents showed great resistance in adhering to medication 
prescriptions for diabetes control due to their various side effects, especially 
within the stomach. In order to avoid such side effects, respondents decreased 
medication dosage and turned to non-allopathic remedies that usually consisted 
of herbal medications that, according to Indians and Pakistanis, did not cause 
side effects as medications did and tackled the cause of the disease rather than 
its symptoms. Such remedies however, were not only combined with allopathic ones 
but also eventually replaced without the doctor's consultation.
