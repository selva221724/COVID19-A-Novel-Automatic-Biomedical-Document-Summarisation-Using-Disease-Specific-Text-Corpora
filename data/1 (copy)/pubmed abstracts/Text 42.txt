
ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The global problem of diabetes, together with 
the limited access of large numbers of patients to conventional antidiabetic 
medicines, continues to drive the search for new agents. Ancient Asian systems 
such as traditional Chinese medicine, Japanese Kampo medicine, and Indian 
Ayurvedic medicine, as well as African traditional medicine and many others have 
identified numerous plants reported anecdotally to treat diabetes; there are 
probably more than 800 such plants for which there is scientific evidence for 
their activity, mostly from studies using various models of diabetes in 
experimental animals.
