A number of plants have been described in Ayurveda and other traditional 
medicine for the management of diabetes. However, information about them is not 
easily available. Active constituents of any medicinal plant define the efficacy 
and safety of treatment to control hyperglycemia. We describe the database to 
maintain the record of medicinal plants having anti-hyperglycemic or 
anti-diabetic activity. The database contains information such as plant name, 
its geographical distribution, useful plant part, known dosage, active 
constituents, mechanism of action and clinical/experimental data. The database 
also includes information about plant raw material suppliers or manufacturers in 
India. The current database includes 238 plants species and 123 Indian 
industries using them.
