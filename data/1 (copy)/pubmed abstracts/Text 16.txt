Mangrove ecosystem has many potential species that are traditionally used by the 
coastal communities for their traditional cure for health ailments as evidenced 
by their extensive uses to treat hepatic disorders, diabetes, gastrointestinal 
disorders, anti-inflammation, anticancer, and skin diseases, etc. In recent 
times, the diabetes mellitus (DM), a serious physiological disorder all over the 
world, occur due to the relative or complete deficiency of insulin in the body, 
characterized by an abnormally high blood glucose level. India has a rich 
traditional knowledge on plant-based drug formulations that are protective and 
curative for many health ailments. In this context, we aimed to compile the 
works done on the antidiabetic activities of mangrove species from Indian 
coastal regions especially on Andaman and Nicobar Islands as well as some recent 
works reported from other countries. A total of 126 published articles and 31 
mangrove species related pieces of information were gathered with reference to 
antidiabetic properties of mangroves. This review summarizes the chemical 
structures, molecular formula, molecular weight, and their biological activities 
with an aspiration that it might be helpful for the future bioprospecting 
industries who are interested in develop the natural drugs for DM.
