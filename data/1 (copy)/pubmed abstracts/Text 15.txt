
Many plants have been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in Indian 
system of medicine and in other ancient systems of the world. Out of these only 
a few have been evaluated as per modern system of medicine. From many such 
plants only extracts have been prepared and their usefulness evaluated in 
experimental diabetes in animals. In some plants likeAllium cepa, Allium 
sativum, Ficus bengalensis, Gymnema sylvestre, Pterocarpus marsupium etc. active 
hypoglycemic principles have been isolated and their mechanism of action 
studied. Most of them seem to act directly on pancreas (pancreatic effect) and 
stimulate insulin level in blood. Some have extra pancreatic effect also by 
acting directly on tissues like liver, muscle etc. and alter favourably the 
activities of the regulatory enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and other 
pathways. Since the plant products have less side effects, they have the 
potential as good hypoglycemic drugs. They may also provide clues for the 
development of new and better oral drugs for diabetes.
