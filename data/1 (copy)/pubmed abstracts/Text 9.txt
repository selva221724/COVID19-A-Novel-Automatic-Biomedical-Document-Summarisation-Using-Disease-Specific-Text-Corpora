Medicinal plants have played an important role in treating and preventing a 
variety of diseases throughout the world. Metabolic syndrome had become a global 
epidemic, defined as a cluster of three of five criteria: insulin resistance and 
glucose intolerance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, low high-density 
cholesterol, and hypertriglyceridemia. The current review focuses on Indian 
medicinal plant drugs and plants used in the treatment of diabetes and 
hyperlipidemia. Though there are various approaches to reduce the ill-effects of 
diabetes and hyperlipidemia and its secondary complications, plant-based drugs 
are preferred due to lesser side effects and low cost. The current review 
focuses on twenty-three medicinal plants used in the treatment of Diabetes 
mellitus and nine medicinal plants used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The 
wealth of knowledge on medicinal plants points to a great potential for research 
and the discovery of new drugs to fight diseases, including diabetes and 
hyperlipidemia.
