# COVID19: A Novel Automatic Biomedical Document Summarisation Using Disease Specific Text Corpora

## Abstract 

This research work firstly proposes a method for automatically generating
multiple disease-specific text corpora by referring appropriate biomedical research articles.
These disease-specific text corpuses updated whenever new research articles of appropriate
kinds are added to the database. Secondly, query-based disease-specific text corpora are
included as a dictionary to identify the relevant documents to enhance the performance of text
summarization. The proposed approach is validated on COVID-19 disease-related research
articles and contains four phases. The first phase employs the SciSpacy model to extract the
biological entities. The second phase utilizes Yake unsupervised algorithm to extract the
coVID-19 related keywords. The third phase removes the common key phrases generated
from the above two phrases. The fourth phase feeds the keywords generated from the first
and second phases as input to modify the text rank algorithm where the user-defined
keywords will be assigned as a higher node compared to other keyword nodes to increase the
accuracy level of summarisation. The proposed method outperforms the other summarisation
approaches and showcases a Rouge score of P: 58.93 R: 62.26 FI1:60.56.

## Initial Development  
**Plot Boundary Generation**
- The conventional data was having data of 12 dates to build the time-series sequence of plots. The approach that needs to be developed is based on the plot boundary across all dates.
- Plot boundary was generated using the automated plot boundary algorithm, but the approach towards this type of fields was based on the fish-net source. From the given fishnet boundary, the algorithm will be able to process the plots one by one and it will shrink the plot boundary based on the size of plots. 

**Positional Accuracy**
- The time series analysis is based on the plot boundary generated by the algorithm. The accurate prediction depends upon the positional accuracy of the orthomosic across dates needs to be much more accurate without any shifts. 
- The orthomosic across the dates were having a tolerance of 4 cm shifting which is good enough accurate to perform the analysis.   

## Docker Container
![alt text](Readme_images/download.png)

The Docker container can be deployed in two methods,

1. Deploying the Docker Image from pre-built Image(.tar) file (Fastest approach) 
2. Building the Docker Image using the Docker file

### 1. Deploying the Docker Image from pre-built Image

- Please use the below link to download the prebuilt Image and It can be loaded into the Docker and deployed 
- [Click This Link To Download Docker Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fszh1vR5nyhsLDEUC0kbmuURveKqCS_t/view?usp=sharing)
- Once the image file downloaded, go to the path which contains image and open the terminal and execute 
```bash
$ sudo docker load -i 'soy_rm.tar' 
```
- Now, the docker image is ready to run 
- The src should be the soy_rm repo path
```bash
$ sudo docker run -it --mount src="PATH to soy_rm Repo",target=/test_container,type=bind  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix  soy_rm 
```
- it will open the docker container shell and run the script 
```bash
$ python soy_rm_date.py
```
- It will generate the output kmls in **Matured_Plots_KMLS** directory  


### 2. Building the Docker Image using the Docker File

- The docker file is given in the **/docker** folder. Please follow the instruction to build the docker file. 
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
$ xhost +
$ sudo docker build -t soy_rm .
```
- It will start to build the docker image in your system. Once the Docker built the environment,run this to execute the script 
- The src should be the soy_rm repo path

```bash
$ sudo docker run -it --mount src="PATH to soy_rm Repo",target=/test_container,type=bind  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix  soy_rm
```
- it will throw an error which says that **"no modules name: urilib2"** 


```bash
$ sudo docker run -i -t soy_rm:latest /bin/bash
```
- This will change the terminal to docker container shell. Install the nano package to edit the python script by using below commands 

```bash
$ apt-get install nano
$ nano /opt/conda/envs/soy_rm/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pykml/parser.py
```
- It will open the parser.py and the change this **import urllib2** to **import urllib as urllib2**
- Press **CTRL+X** and Press **Y** and **ENTER**
- after type **exit** to exit the container shell
- This will save the parser.py script and prevents from the error 
- Lets commit the changes in the Image file using the container ID
- <container_id> can be identified in shell command
 
```bash
 $ sudo docker commit <container_id> soy_rm
```
 ![alt text](Readme_images/id.png)
 
- In this ID container_id:**c2e85bc1c416**
- Now lets run the terminal again & execute the python script 
```bash
$ sudo docker run -it --mount src="PATH to soy_rm Repo",target=/test_container,type=bind  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix  soy_rm
$ python soy_rm_date.py
```
- It will generate the output kmls in **Matured_Plots_KMLS** directory
